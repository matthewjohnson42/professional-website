    <p>
        Hello! Welcome to my website.
    </p>
    <p>
        I have created this website for the convenience of yourself, the individual
        who has chosen to take the time to investigate the contents of my eponymous website. My hope is that any questions you might
        have about myself are given greater insight during your visit to this site.
    </p>
    <p>
        I graduated cum laude in December 2017 from Augsburg University with a Bachelor of the Sciences degree in Computer
        Science and a Bachelor of the Arts degree in Computational Philosophy. I chose to study these subjects
        as I have a long standing interest in the logical structures that give form to the world of the individual and that
        are revealed to us through a precise inspection of the intersubjective world. Computer Science was a practical
        application of this curiosity and Computational Philosophy, if nothing more, was a wonderful excuse to be able to study
        the foundations of critical reasoning in the western world and of the quest for meaning that might be considered to be entailed
        by such a criticality of mind. I also took a minor in Mathematics while studying at Augsburg University.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prior to my studies at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, Minnesota, I had worked at United HealthGroup where I performed the duties of a
        software quality assurance consultant. These duties involved developing an understanding of the function of the
        project I was assigned to and using that understanding to ensure that such a function was realized with minimal errors.
        Before that, I had also spent time studying at Century College in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. It was there that I determined that
        the study of Computer Science would be a profitable course of action that I would be comfortable with pursuing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently I am looking for employment as a software developer. I would like to specialize as a Java developer and later move
        on towards doing development in big data. My motivation for a pursuit of a career as a Java developer in big data is to be able to
        work with large volumes of textual data doing analysis of that data. This would be the realm of things like Salesforce Einstein,
        email spam filters, Google search query processing and prediction, or the auto-complete feature included with many modern cell phones.
        I find language to be a very curious thing as it seems to create a sort of boundary for human knowledge, one that limits knowledge to
        that which is articulable, expressable, or actionable. Everything else is a sort of holiday language, something that we must pass over in
        silence. It is this curiosity of constraint that pulls me forward.

    <h1 class="h-center">Projects</h1>
    <p>
        I have worked on several projects during the time that I have spent building my understanding of the world of programming. I have not worked on anything at the
        level of an enterprise application, but I have been responsible for the completion of projects of modest size. Throughout the completion of the various projects that
        I have worked on, I have done my best to balance developing a complete understanding of the material being used along with the expediance necessary to be able to
        deliver the project on time. For me the technology, be it a langauge or framework, is more often than not the means to an end. This is not to say that I do not value
        the technologies that I have drawn upon, but rather that for myself understanding of the functioning of these technologies has more often than not better enabled me
        to utilize them than focusing on the narrow details such as the syntax of a language or obscure semantics. When I have the function of the project in mind, the details
        tend to fill in as I proceed.
    </p>
    <h1 class="h-left">MACCS Neural Network</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        The MACCS Neural Network was a research project that I conducted in the summer of 2017 at Augsburg College (now University). The goal of the project was to automate the
        recognition of anomalous activity in the data of the MACCS project at Augsburg. The MACCS project is a study of the earth's magnetosphere near the north pole. Activity
        recorded by the MACCS projects included things such as solar flares. The final version of the neural network recognized the so termed anomalous patterns in magnetosphere
        data with a peak accuracy of 97.16% and an average accuracy for that particular neural network architecture of 96.58%.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        The first step of the project was to create a labeled set of magnetosphere data. It was determined that there was an insufficient amount of recent data from the MACCS
        project, a result of hardware errors on the servers that stored the data. Instead, we utilized data from the British Antarctic Survey's search coil magnetometers located at the
        Halley research station. The data was parsed by myself and a team member of the Augsburg College Physics Department, Jennifer Posch, and a formal definition for anomalies
        was created. This definition was then used to hand label a set of 1117 days worth of data from the search coil magnetometers at BAS Halley Site.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        After having labeled data from the BAS Halley Site's SCM array, the raw data that the labels corresponded to were passed through a fast fourier transform using the SciPy
        library for the python programming language. After the data was transformed, it was used as input to neural networks that were defined using the Keras python library with
        the Keras code being translated by the library into TensorFlow code. Many different network architectures were tried, all of them closely following the pioneering convolutional
        neural network architecture defined by LeCun et al in 1998 (referred to as LeNet). These networks were trained on an Intel 32-core server with varying training parameters.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        There were several difficulties that were encountered when training networks. One was that the networks seemed to be overfitting their models to the data, meaning that the
        networks were being trained to recognize patterns that while present were not relevant to the pattern that the labels were intended to correspond to. This was determined by
        conversation with the mentoring professor, Erik Steinmetz, where it was discussed that neural networks do very well with classification tasks that have sufficiently distinct
        inputs and yet the networks that were being trained were not doing well. The overfitting hypothesis was confirmed when dropout layers were added to the network, a training parameter for
        the Keras library that drops a certain percentage of the model each time the model is fit to a particular set of the training data. Another difficulty that was encountered was
        the need to format the data to a minimally precise representation of the data, which would then allow for the network to more reliably extract the patterns from
        the data. This problem was similar to the over fitting problem, where a more precise representation of the data allowed for the network to be fit to patterns in that were
        present in smaller variances in the data but were not relevant to the pattern that was intended to be recognized. This was solved by splitting the data into ranges of fixed
        size, and by removing the lowest frequency from those ranges to remove some of the noise from the data. With these changes, the network's accuracy jumped from ~85% to ~96%.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        I also created a research poster and wrote a paper about this research. The poster may be found <a href="docs/MACCSPoster.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. The paper may be found

    </p>
    <h1 class="h-left">Pascal Compiler</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        Another project that I undertook is my Pascal compiler, which was a project that constituted the capstone for the Computer Science curriculum at Augsburg College,
        now Augsburg University. The compiler is implemented in Java and was tested using Junit. It was completed in April 2017.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        The compiler is a recursive descent compiler that utilizes a non deterministic finite automaton for tokenization and a context free grammar
        for the construction of the syntax tree. The target language is MIPS assembly, an older assembly language that is utilized in coursework at Augsburg University. The
        grammar was provided to the students along with the recursive descent compiler architecture. Tokenization was to be completed using the tool JFlex, a piece of Java
        software that takes as input a text file specifying a state machine and providing as output the Java implementation of that state machine. Implementation and unit testing
        the compiler specifications were left to the students. Put simply, this compiler takes as input a file containing text written in a subset of the language Pascal and
        provides as output the assembly instructions for a CPU that uses the MIPS architecture.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        There are several things that are notable about this project in regards to my performance on implementation. First, the compiler performs exactly to specification.
        I received a 4.0 of 4.0 for this capstone. Second, the compiler included functionality that was dismissed from the compiler specifications based on the amount of time
        remaining for students to be able to complete the project. This functionality was the inclusion of callable methods/functions and of arrays.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        I very much enjoyed the compiler project. It was a reasonably complex piece of software and although it does not compile all Pascal code, I am content to know that I
        was capable of understanding compiler theory with sufficient precision so as to be able to create this compiler. The theory really was what interested me most about the
        course as it really does dig into the logic that it was necessary to develop in order to be able to create compilers. This is an example of my preference for the theory
        and concepts involved in a project above the details of an implementation.

    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">

    </p>
    <h1 class="h-left">Saberpack Production Control</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        This is a project that I undertook in months of May and June in 2016. It is a piece of software that tracks the production of a glass packaging product for the purposes
        of retaining quality assurance for that glass packaging product. The product is called glass interleaving powder, and is a substance placed between large flat panes of glass
        prior to the glass being shipped from the glass production facility. The software takes as input the weight of a bag of the interleaving powder and provides as output a
        bag label with a lot and bag number. This data, along with user input specifying environmental conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, was stored in a database
        for later reference. The software was deployed to the manufacturing environments at Saberpack in June of 2016, where it continues to reliably track the production of material.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        This project was a rebuild of an existing piece of software that was written in Visual Basic. The existing piece of software was written in 2008 and was desgined to run
        on Windows XP machines and utilizing the .NET framework version 2.0 to interface with comm port peripherals and with a SQL Server Express 2007 instance. The goal of this
        project was to get the software running on new machines that could replace the aging equipment located in an environment with high amounts of particulate in the air.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        There were major hurdles in this project, with the first one being a .NET dependency that did not have an equivalent distribution for versions of Windows later than XP.
        Given that XP was no longer being supported by Microsoft, it was suggested that the code base be updated to run on a more modern operating system. Windows 10 was chosen
        as the operating system based on Microsoft's stated plans for supporting their operating systems, and C# was chosen as the language of implementation based on the observation
        that the language is well supported on modern Windows distributions and has well supported access to the .NET framework. Another major hurdle for myself as a developer was
        the schedule for the delivery of this software. The planned expense for this project was fairly low and thus the time I had to develop this software was limited. The result
        this was that corners were cut in the course of development to ensure the project was completed on time. For example, there was no test suite used to test this software; all
        testing was done by analysing stack traces or using break points and console output.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        There is one main thing that is notable about this project in regrads to my performance: I went into a situation where I had no knowledge of the existing tech stack,
        limited documentation (only code comments), no communication with the original developer, and yet within two months I had learned enough about the function of the software
        to be able to provide a technology solution for the company. I did not know SQL Server before this project. I did not know C# prior to this project. I had never worked with
        the .NET framework. I implemented this software solution using C#.NET and SQL Server Express in two months.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        I cannot provide reference to this code as it is proprietary software.
    </p>
    <h1 class="h-left">Sentiment Analysis Self Study</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        I have an ongoing interest in sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis as it is referred to in some academic publications is the study of affect, emotion, or sentiment in a
        given portion of text. It is an emerging area of study. One application of sentiment analysis that was in the news in early 2018 was Facebook's determination to ramp up efforts
        to detect hate speech and inaccurate news reports. While the analysis that is likely to be relevant to the automated detection of inaccuracy in reporting is not quite the
        same area of analysis as sentiment analysis, the analysis that might be utilized in the pursuit of an automated detection of inflammatory speech is quite close to sentiment
        analysis if not the same. My interest in sentiment analysis rose in part from an observation of language forming a sort of natural barrier to human knowledge, if not only in
        that knowledge which may be meaningfully expressed. I chose to pursue a study of sentiment analysis during my last semester at Augsburg University under Professor Erik Steinmetz.
        The product of that study was a paper that can be found <a href="https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/sentiment-analysis/blob/master/documentation/paper/study-ontology-supported-sentiment-analysis.pdf">
        here</a>.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        I have created a fairly small repository of the programming that I've done on my own time relating to sentiment analysis. I haven't done much with it yet, but should I happen
        to find for myself that I am capable of pursuing a continued study of sentiment analysis in my spare time I might consider making something more of it. The first step for this
        ongoing project is to create a very simple sentiment analyzer that takes in a string of text, splits it into distinct words and then assigns a score to each word based on a
        sentiment lexicon (I am utilizing SentiWordNet 3.0 on my first go). The score of all words in the document are then totaled, giving a very rough approximation of the general
        sentiment of the text either positive or negative. This is the simplest form of sentiment analysis and is referred to as polarity classification.

    <h1 class="h-left">Scripts</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        I have scripts for days. Most of them are batch scripts, PowerShell scripts, or Python scripts. I don't think I've ever gone to the effort to save a bash script as most of
        the operations that I use bash for are fairly simple. If you would like to see some of my scripts I can most certainly provide them to you via email. I do not list them
        publicly as they are fairly hackish things that don't really illustrate much and aren't likely to be of use to anyone besides myself.
    </p>
    <h1 class="h-left">Website</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
        This website also constitutes a project, I suppose. It is not terribly impressive technically but it is a site that I built from scratch. I did not use word press, nor did
        I recycle code from a template. I started typing an HTML document and many hours later, I had produced a webpage. I picked up some CSS to properly format this page, and was
        provided a very small amount of exposure to JavaScript to enable small details for the navigation of the webpage. You can find the source for the page both from the webserver
        that is hosting this page and from my <a href="https://github.com/matthewjohnson42/website" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

        I like a lot of stuff. Almost everything. At some point in the past, I had a realization that I would be unable to literally know
        everything and do anything. It would appear for myself there simply is not enough time to know all Mathematics,
        all Physics, all Chemistry, all of Science, all of Philosophy, all of that which gives meaning to humanity; that there is not enough
        time to see every point on the planet and to have conversations with every one of its inhabitants, that I lack the time to be able
        to experience all that this planet has to offer. As a result of this realization, I am now doing my best to stay focused on
        several areas in which I might develop proficiency and demonstrate excellence while simultaneously retaining a curiosity that is inclined
        to consider the broader and wider fullness that is the human experience. So far it seems like the areas that I have the most drive
        for are computer science and linguistics, along with camping to keep me anchored in the real world. I am not always convinced that
        these interests are anything but arbitrary, and there are days where this drive is greater than others. Despite this, I continue along
        with the subjects that I have thus far chosen to pursue.

            For the computer science and linguistics stuff, please do check out the links I have provided in the <a href="#projects">Projects</a>
            section of this page. For the stuff that anchors me, that perhaps allow me appear a little bit more human than machine, I have included
            a image browser to the right that shows several of the pictures that I have taken on my journies. The journies that I have included in
            this image browser are from a trip to the Badlands that I took in 2015 and a trip through the American West that I had undertaken in 2017.
            Both of these journies pushed my boundaries of self comfort and in doing so expanded my horizons. The next long trip I plan to take is
            a excursion to Death Valley during the middle of winter when I might actually be able to camp there without an air conditioned tent.

            On an average day, you will hopefully find me busy at work or engaged with something stimulating like a book, video game, or my guitar.
