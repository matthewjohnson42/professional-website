  <p>
	Hello! Welcome to my website.
  </p>
  <p>
	I have created this website for the convenience of yourself, the individual
	who has chosen to take the time to investigate the contents of my eponymous website. My hope is that any questions you might
	have about myself are given greater insight during your visit to this site.
  </p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="mj-panel-left-align" id="introduction">
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
	I graduated cum laude in December 2017 from Augsburg University with a Bachelor of the Sciences degree in Computer
	Science and a Bachelor of the Arts degree in Computational Philosophy. I chose to study these subjects
	as I have a long standing interest in the logical structures that give form to the world of the individual and that
	are revealed to us through a precise inspection of the intersubjective world of the social organism. Computer Science was a practical
	application of this curiosity and Computational Philosophy, if nothing more, was a wonderful excuse to be able to study
	the foundations of reason and meaning as they are represented in the traditions of western philosophy. I also took
	a minor in Mathematics while studying at Augsburg University.
  </p>
  <p>
	Prior to my studies at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, Minnesota, I had worked at United HealthGroup where I performed the duties of a
	software quality assurance consultant. These duties involved developing an understanding of the function of the
	project I was assigned to and using that understanding to ensure that such a function was realized with minimal errors.
	Before that, I had also spent time studying at Century College in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. It was there that I determined that
	the study of Computer Science would be a profitable course of action that I would be comfortable with pursuing.
  </p>
  <p>
	Currently I am looking for employment as a software developer. I would like to specialize as a Java developer and later move
	on towards doing development in big data. My motivation for a pursuit of a career as a Java developer in big data is to be able to
	work with large volumes of textual data doing analysis of that data. This would be the realm of things like Salesforce Einstein,
	email spam filters, Google search query processing and prediction, or the auto-complete feature included with many modern cell phones.
	I find language to be a very curious thing as it seems to create a sort of boundary for human knowledge, one that limits knowledge to
	that which is articulable, expressable, or actionable. Everything else is a sort of holiday language, something that we must pass over in
	silence. It is this curiosity of constraint that pulls me forward.

  <h3>Personal</h3>
  <p>
    I like a lot of stuff. Almost everything. At some point in the past, I had a realization that I would be unable to literally know
    everything and do anything. It would appear for myself there simply is not enough time to know all Mathematics,
    all Physics, all Chemistry, all of Science, all of Philosophy, all of that which gives meaning to humanity; that there is not enough
    time to see every point on the planet and to have conversations with every one of its inhabitants, that I lack the time to be able
    to experience all that this planet has to offer. As a result of this realization, I am now doing my best to stay focused on
    several areas in which I might develop proficiency and demonstrate excellence while simultaneously retaining a curiosity that is inclined
    to consider the broader and wider fullness that is the human experience. So far it seems like the areas that I have the most drive
    for are computer science and linguistics, along with camping to keep me anchored in the real world. I am not always convinced that
    these interests are anything but arbitrary, and there are days where this drive is greater than others. Despite this, I continue along
    with the subjects that I have thus far chosen to pursue.
  </p>
  <div class="mj-half">
    <p>
	  For the computer science and linguistics stuff, please do check out the links I have provided in the <a href="#projects">Projects</a>
      section of this page. For the stuff that anchors me, that perhaps allow me appear a little bit more human than machine, I have included
      a image browser to the right that shows several of the pictures that I have taken on my journies. The journies that I have included in
      this image browser are from a trip to the Badlands that I took in 2015 and a trip through the American West that I had undertaken in 2017.
      Both of these journies pushed my boundaries of self comfort and in doing so expanded my horizons. The next long trip I plan to take is
      a excursion to Death Valley during the middle of winter when I might actually be able to camp there without an air conditioned tent.
	</p>
    <p>
	  On an average day, you will hopefully find me busy at work or engaged with something stimulating like a book, video game, or my guitar.
