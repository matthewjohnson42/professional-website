  <p>
	Hello! Welcome to my website.
  </p>
  <p>
	I have created this website for the convenience of yourself, the individual
	who has chosen to take the time to investigate the contents of my eponymous website. My hope is that any questions you might
	have about myself are given greater insight during your visit to this site.
  </p>
  <p>
	I graduated cum laude in December 2017 from Augsburg University with a Bachelor of the Sciences degree in Computer
	Science and a Bachelor of the Arts degree in Computational Philosophy. I chose to study these subjects
	as I have a long standing interest in the logical structures that give form to the world of the individual and that
	are revealed to us through a precise inspection of the intersubjective world of the social organism. Computer Science was a practical
	application of this curiosity and Computational Philosophy, if nothing more, was a wonderful excuse to be able to study
	the foundations of critical reasoning and of the quest for providing the world meaning. I also took
	a minor in Mathematics while studying at Augsburg University.
  </p>
  <p>
	Prior to my studies at Augsburg University in Minneapolis, Minnesota, I had worked at United HealthGroup where I performed the duties of a
	software quality assurance consultant. These duties involved developing an understanding of the function of the
	project I was assigned to and using that understanding to ensure that such a function was realized with minimal errors.
	Before that, I had also spent time studying at Century College in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. It was there that I determined that
	the study of Computer Science would be a profitable course of action that I would be comfortable with pursuing.
  </p>
  <p>
	Currently I am looking for employment as a software developer. I would like to specialize as a Java developer and later move
	on towards doing development in big data. My motivation for a pursuit of a career as a Java developer in big data is to be able to
	work with large volumes of textual data doing analysis of that data. This would be the realm of things like Salesforce Einstein,
	email spam filters, Google search query processing and prediction, or the auto-complete feature included with many modern cell phones.
	I find language to be a very curious thing as it seems to create a sort of boundary for human knowledge, one that limits knowledge to
	that which is articulable, expressable, or actionable. Everything else is a sort of holiday language, something that we must pass over in
	silence. It is this curiosity of constraint that pulls me forward.
  </p>

  <h1 class="h-center">Projects</h1>
  <p>
	I have worked on several projects during the time that I have spent building my understanding of the world of programming. I have not worked on anything at the
	level of an enterprise application, but I have been responsible for the completion of projects of modest size. Throughout the completion of the various projects that
	I have worked on, I have done my best to balance developing a complete understanding of the material being used along with the expediance necessary to be able to 
	deliver the project on time. For me the technology, be it a langauge or framework, is more often than not the means to an end. This is not to say that I do not value 
	the technologies that I have drawn upon, but rather that for myself understanding of the functioning of these technologies has more often than not better enabled me 
	to utilize them than focusing on the narrow details such as the syntax of a language or obscure semantics. When I have the function of the project in mind, the details 
	tend to fill in as I proceed.
  </p>
  <h1 class="h-left">MACCS Neural Network</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
  </p>
  <h1 class="h-left">Pascal Compiler</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
	Another project that I undertook is my Pascal compiler, which was a project that constituted the capstone for the Computer Science curriculum at Augsburg College,
	now Augsburg University. The compiler is implemented in Java and was tested using Junit. It was completed in April 2017.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
	The compiler is a recursive descent compiler that utilizes a non deterministic finite automaton for tokenization and a context free grammar 
	for the construction of the syntax tree. The target language is MIPS assembly, an older assembly language that is utilized in coursework at Augsburg University. The 
	grammar was provided to the students along with the recursive descent compiler architecture. Tokenization was to be completed using the tool JFlex, a piece of Java 
	software that takes as input a text file specifying a state machine and providing as output the Java implementation of that state machine. Implementation and unit testing 
	the compiler specifications were left to the students. Put simply, this compiler takes as input a file containing text written in a subset of the language Pascal and 
	provides as output the assembly instructions for a CPU that uses the MIPS architecture.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
    There are several things that are notable about this project in regards to my performance on implementation. First, the compiler performs exactly to specification.
	I received a 4.0 of 4.0 for this capstone. Second, the compiler included functionality that was dismissed from the compiler specifications based on the amount of time
	remaining for students to be able to complete the project. This functionality was the inclusion of callable methods/functions and of arrays.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
    I very much enjoyed the compiler project. It was a reasonably complex piece of software and although it does not compile all Pascal code, I am content to know that I 
	was capable of understanding compiler theory with sufficient precision so as to be able to create this compiler. The theory really was what interested me most about the
	course as it really does dig into the logic that it was necessary to develop in order to be able to create compilers. This is an example of my preference for the theory 
	and concepts involved in a project above the details of an implementation.
  </p>
  <h1 class="h-left">Saberpack Production Control</h1>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
    This is a project that I undertook in months of May and June in 2016. It is a piece of software that tracks the production of a glass packaging product for the purposes
	of retaining quality assurance for that glass packaging product. The product is called glass interleaving powder, and is a substance placed between large flat panes of glass
	prior to the glass being shipped from the glass production facility. The software takes as input the weight of a bag of the interleaving powder and provides as output a 
	bag label with a lot and bag number. This data, along with user input specifying environmental conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, was stored in a database 
	for later reference. The software was deployed to the manufacturing environments at Saberpack in June of 2016, where it continues to reliably track the production of material.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
    This project was a rebuild of an existing piece of software that was written in Visual Basic. The existing piece of software was written in 2008 and was desgined to run 
	on Windows XP machines and utilizing the .NET framework version 2.0 to interface with comm port peripherals and with a SQL Server Express 2007 instance. The goal of this 
	project was to get the software running on new machines that could replace the aging equipment located in an environment with high amounts of particulate in the air.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
    There were major hurdles in this project, with the first one being a .NET dependency that did not have an equivalent distribution for versions of Windows later than XP.
	Given that XP was no longer being supported by Microsoft, it was suggested that the code base be updated to run on a more modern operating system. Windows 10 was chosen 
	as the operating system based on Microsoft's stated plans for supporting their operating systems, and C# was chosen as the language of implementation based on the observation 
	that the language is well supported on modern Windows distributions and has well supported access to the .NET framework. Another major hurdle for myself as a developer was 
	the schedule for the delivery of this software. The planned expense for this project was fairly low and thus the time I had to develop this software was limited. The result
    this was that corners were cut in the course of development to ensure the project was completed on time. For example, there was no test suite used to test this software; all 
	testing was done by analysing stack traces or using break points and console output.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left: 2.5vw;">
    There is one main thing that is notable about this project in regrads to my performance: I went into a situation where I had no knowledge of the existing tech stack,
	limited documentation (only code comments), no communication with the original developer, and yet within two months I had learned enough about the function of the software 
	to be able to provide a technology solution for the company. I did not know SQL Server before this project. I did not know C# prior to this project. I had never worked with 
	the .NET framework. I implemented this software solution using C#.NET and SQL Server Express in two months.

    I like a lot of stuff. Almost everything. At some point in the past, I had a realization that I would be unable to literally know
    everything and do anything. It would appear for myself there simply is not enough time to know all Mathematics,
    all Physics, all Chemistry, all of Science, all of Philosophy, all of that which gives meaning to humanity; that there is not enough
    time to see every point on the planet and to have conversations with every one of its inhabitants, that I lack the time to be able
    to experience all that this planet has to offer. As a result of this realization, I am now doing my best to stay focused on
    several areas in which I might develop proficiency and demonstrate excellence while simultaneously retaining a curiosity that is inclined
    to consider the broader and wider fullness that is the human experience. So far it seems like the areas that I have the most drive
    for are computer science and linguistics, along with camping to keep me anchored in the real world. I am not always convinced that
    these interests are anything but arbitrary, and there are days where this drive is greater than others. Despite this, I continue along
    with the subjects that I have thus far chosen to pursue.
  </p>
  <div class="half-panel">
    <p>
	  For the computer science and linguistics stuff, please do check out the links I have provided in the <a href="#projects">Projects</a>
      section of this page. For the stuff that anchors me, that perhaps allow me appear a little bit more human than machine, I have included
      a image browser to the right that shows several of the pictures that I have taken on my journies. The journies that I have included in
      this image browser are from a trip to the Badlands that I took in 2015 and a trip through the American West that I had undertaken in 2017.
      Both of these journies pushed my boundaries of self comfort and in doing so expanded my horizons. The next long trip I plan to take is
      a excursion to Death Valley during the middle of winter when I might actually be able to camp there without an air conditioned tent.

    <p>
	  On an average day, you will hopefully find me busy at work or engaged with something stimulating like a book, video game, or my guitar.
